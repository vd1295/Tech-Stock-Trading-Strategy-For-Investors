# Tech-Stock-Trading-Strategy-For-Investors
Creating an alternate investment model that institutional investors can use to predict, project and account for seasonality and other factors, alongside SPY index.

For this cause, I explore and visualize tech stocks, trying to identify Regimes, Patterns, and more. Then backtest, benchmark against SPY, and reach some inevitable conclusions.
